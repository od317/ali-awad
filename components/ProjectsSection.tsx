The tower's base has an octagonal shape to provide larger and smoother internal circulation areas, along with the addition of an interactive outdoor space covered with a treated glass canopy, featuring an open-close mechanism as needed.

Interactive public spaces, green areas, and water surfaces were provided, along with the inclusion of service roads around the plot to optimally serve all functions within the project.

The tower was formed from four square floor plans, each rotated 45 degrees from the other, giving the tower a fractured form and triangular-shaped fa√ßades.

Structural system of the tower: load-bearing core.
Structural system of the podium: ribbed slabs and columns.
Structural system of the basements: hollow-core slabs (hourdi), retaining walls, and columns.`,
